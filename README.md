# HealthNOW Final Project

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to build a mobile application for the medical industry. The app is designed for patients who are monitored by medical professionals.
</br>
</br>
The application is built using the React Native JavaScript library. The application is cross-platform, able to run on both Android and iOS systems. HealthNOW utilizes Google Firebase for user authentication and data storage. The user interface for the application follows most standard medical applications. Font colors are set to white or light blue for accessibility purposes.

User Stories:

1) The user is able to login to the application by providing a known email/password. 
2) If the email/password are unknown to HealthNOW...the user can register their name, email, and password.
3) The user is brought to their patient dashboard upon successful login/registration
4) On the patient dashboard, the user can navigate to a message room, see a list of their devices, set reminders, or sign out
5) On the message room, the user connects with a medical professional to discuss patient information
6) On the device screen, the user is able to check the results from various third-party medical devices including: Thermometer, Blood Pressure Machine, Glucometer, Weight Scale
7) On the reminders screen the user is able to set reminders through their phone's calendar app
8) Finally, the user is able to sign out of the application

## Database 

HealthNOW uses Google Firebase for user authentication and data storage. The user is authenticated using the email and password feature provided by Google Firebase.

Google Firebase Firestore holds all messages generated by the user for access and display in the chat room. Here is an image of the Firestore collection, "chat," with a selected document showing a chat message:

Each document will contain a message ID, date of creation, message text, and user information (ID and name)

## Chat Module

The chat module allows a patient to connect with a medical professional or administrator to review results or discuss upcoming/recent appointments. When navigating to the chat module, the user will be required to input their name. The entered name will be checked with the profile in Google Firebase to initialize the user's intended chat room. The dependency, react-native-gifted-chat, contains the UI for the chat room. A button below the chat allows the user to exit the chat room.
