# HealthNOW Final Project

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to build a mobile application for the medical industry. The app is designed for patients who are monitored by medical professionals.
</br>
</br>
The application is built using the React Native JavaScript library. The application is cross-platform, able to run on both Android and iOS systems. HealthNOW utilizes Google Firebase for user authentication and data storage. The user interface for the application follows most standard medical applications. Font colors are set to white or light blue for accessibility.

User Stories:

1) The user is able to login to the application by providing a known email/password. 
2) If the email/password are unknown to HealthNOW...the user can register their name, email, and password.
3) The user is brought to their patient dashboard upon successful login/registration
4) On the patient dashboard, the user can navigate to a message room, see a list of their devices, or sign out
5) On the message room, the user connects with a medical professional to discuss patient information
6) On the device screen, the user is able to check the results from various third-party medical devices including: Thermometer, Blood Pressure Machine, Glucometer, Weight Scale
7) Finally, the user is able to sign out of the application

## Database 

HealthNOW uses Google Firebase for user authentication and data storage. The user is authenticated using the email and password feature provided by Google Firebase.

Here is an image of the authentication page on Google Firebase, showing all the current users of HealthNOW:

Google Firebase Firestore holds all messages generated by the user for access and display in the chat room. Here is an image of the Firestore collection, "chat," with the selected document showing a chat message:

Each document will contain a message ID, date of creation, message text, and user information (ID and name).

Firestore will also store all the metrics for every HealthNOW user. These values are stored in the "metrics" collection. Documents in this collection are labeled by the user email. Here is an image of the Firestore collection, "metrics," with the selected document showing my temperature, blood pressure, weight, and blood sugar:

Every user document will contain the fields seen in the image above.

## Authentication Module

There are two parts to user authentication: 

1) Login
2) Registration 

### Login

If the user is already registered into the HealthNOW system, they will only be able to use the login screen for authentication. The user will have to provide the email and password used for registration to complete the login and navigate to the patient dashboard. 

Here is an image showing the login screen:

### Registration 

If the user is new to HealthNOW, they will need to register a new account by navigating to the registration screen. On the registration screen, the user will have to enter their name, email, and password. The email and password field will be needed for future login attempts. After registration, the user will be taken to the patient dashboard. 

Note: The user cannot register an existing account. HealthNOW will notify the user if this happens

Here is an image showing the registration screen:

## Patient Dashboard Module 

The patient dashboard is a simple module. It allows the user to navigate to the device or chat module and sign out of the application.

Here is an image of the patient dashboard module:

## Chat Module

The chat module allows a patient to connect with a medical professional or administrator to review results or discuss upcoming/recent appointments. When navigating to the chat module, the user will be required to input their name. The entered name will be checked with the profile in Google Firebase to initialize the user's intended chat room. The dependency, react-native-gifted-chat, contains the UI for the chat room. A button below the chat allows the user to exit the chat room. 

Here is an image of the inital screen in ChatScreen.js:

## Device Module 

The device module displays the results from third-party medical devices using an API call to Google Firebase Firestore. The data is read by using a document reference, which is found through the user's email address. The metrics available to the user include: 

1) Temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)
2) Blood Pressure (systolic and diastolic)
3) Weight (pounds)
4) Blood Sugar (mg/dl)
